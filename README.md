# Glacier Coverage Classification Project

By _Data Destroyers (Emily Macris - leader, Karan Rawat)_



## Contents of Repository
This repository contains all the work for Project 3 of Prototyping which has the goal of working with image data. Specifcally, the goal of the repository is to answer the question: 
_Can a supervised machine learning classifier detect glacier coverage more accurately than index-threshold methods like NDSI, and how well does it generalize across time and other glacier regions?_<br>




## Section 1 -- Software and Platform
Throughout this project we used Github, Jupyter Notebook, VS Code, Google Earth Engine (GEE) and Python. The packages we used were pandas, seaborn, matplotlib, scipy, numpy, Google Earth Engine (GEE)
All of these packages would have to be downloaded in order to run the notebooks. Both Windows and Mac were used to complete this project.

## Section 3 -- Reproducing the Results

1. [Clone the repository](https://github.com/emilymacris/ds4002-project3)
2. First go to the python notebook _project_3.ipynb_ and run each code box in order. This will produce the data set, EDA's and model.
